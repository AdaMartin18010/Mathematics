# Mathematics Directory Restructuring Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the comprehensive restructuring and formalization of the Math directory (excluding Refactor) into the /Math/Refactor directory. The goal is to extract and organize thematic mathematical content with strict academic standards, formal mathematical rigor, and hierarchical structure.
